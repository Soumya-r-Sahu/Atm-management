# DAO Implementation Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the implementation of a Database Access Object (DAO) pattern in the ATM project, which provides a unified interface for database operations, abstracting the underlying storage mechanism (MySQL or file-based).

## Components Implemented

### 1. DAO Interface
The DAO interface provides a standardized API for interacting with the database, regardless of the underlying implementation. This interface is defined in `include/common/database/dao_interface.h`.

Key functions in the interface:
- Card operations (validation, status checks)
- Account operations (balance management)
- Transaction operations (logging, history)
- Session management (connection handling)

### 2. Implementation Classes
Two implementation classes were created:

#### File-Based DAO (`backend/database/file_based_dao.c`)
- Provides implementations for all DAO interface methods using flat file storage
- Uses file locking mechanisms for transaction safety
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- Optimized for performance with indexed access

#### MySQL DAO (`backend/database/mysql_dao.c`)
- Provides implementations for all DAO interface methods using MySQL
- Implements connection pooling for better performance
- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Handles transaction atomicity correctly

### 3. Factory Pattern (`backend/database/dao_factory.c`)
- Creates the appropriate DAO implementation based on configuration
- Implements a singleton pattern for efficiency
- Allows runtime selection between storage mechanisms

## Modules Updated to Use DAO

The following modules have been updated to use the new DAO pattern:

1. **Transaction Manager**
   - Balance inquiries
   - Deposits
   - Withdrawals
   - Fund transfers
   - Bill payments
   - PIN changes
   - Mini statements

2. **Transaction Processor**
   - All transaction processing now uses the DAO layer
   
3. **Admin Operations**
   - Account creation
   - Card status management
   - PIN regeneration
   - Service mode toggling
   - ATM status management

4. **Account Management**
   - Balance retrieval and updates
   - Cardholder information access
   - Card status validation

## Performance Optimizations

1. **O(1) Access Time**: File-based DAO uses indexed access instead of linear search
2. **Connection Pooling**: MySQL DAO implements connection pooling to reduce overhead
3. **Atomic Updates**: File operations use temporary files for atomic updates
4. **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce I/O operations
5. **Optimized Queries**: MySQL operations use prepared statements and optimized queries

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Abstraction**: Business logic is now separate from data access logic
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to database schema or storage mechanism require changes only in DAO implementations, not in business logic
3. **Testability**: Mock DAOs can be implemented for testing
4. **Storage Flexibility**: Can switch between MySQL and file-based storage with a configuration change
5. **Reduced Duplicate Code**: Common database operations are centralized

## Testing

All DAO methods were tested with:
- Unit tests for each function
- Integration tests for transaction flows
- Stress testing for concurrent operations
- Edge case testing for error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement additional storage backends (e.g., SQLite, Redis)
2. Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
3. Implement transaction journaling for improved recovery
4. Support for distributed database operations

## Conclusion

The DAO pattern implementation has successfully improved the architecture of the ATM project by separating data access concerns from business logic. This will make the system more maintainable and flexible as it evolves.
