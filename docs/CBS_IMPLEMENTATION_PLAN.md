# CBS Reorganization Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step process to implement the reorganization plan for the CBS project.

## Phase 1: Setup and Initial Structure

1. **Run the reorganization script**
   ```powershell
   cd "d:\vs code\soumya\CBS-project"
   .\setup\reorganize_project.ps1
   ```
   This will create the necessary directory structure without moving any files.

2. **Verify directory structure creation**
   - Check that all directories outlined in the reorganization plan were successfully created
   - Address any errors or permission issues

## Phase 2: Database Layer Migration

Follow the detailed steps in `CBS_DATABASE_REORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`:

1. **Analyze existing database files**
   - Identify the purpose of each file in `/backend/database/`
   - Categorize them as MySQL implementation, file-based, or common utilities

2. **Create header files for DAO components**
   - For each implementation file, create a corresponding header file in the appropriate include directory

3. **Copy files to new location (don't move yet)**
   - Copy MySQL implementation files to `/backend/database/mysql/src/`
   - Copy file-based implementation files to `/backend/database/file_based/src/`
   - Copy common utilities and interfaces to `/backend/database/common/src/`
   - Copy header files to their respective include directories

4. **Update include paths** in the copied files
   - Modify `#include` statements to reflect the new directory structure
   - Test compilation to catch any missing includes

5. **Create a test build** using the new structure
   - Update build scripts to include the new directories
   - Verify that the project still builds successfully

6. **Run tests** to ensure functionality
   - Execute all database-related tests to verify functionality
   - Fix any issues that arise

7. **Remove old files** once everything is confirmed working

## Phase 3: Logging System Updates

Follow the detailed steps in `CBS_LOGGING_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`:

1. **Update logger initialization**
   - Modify code to create the new categorized log directories
   - Implement file path construction for different log types

2. **Update log file paths**
   - Modify functions that write logs to use the new directory structure

3. **Test logging functionality**
   - Verify logs are created in the correct directories
   - Ensure all logging features still work as expected

## Phase 4: Binary and Build Script Updates

1. **Update build scripts**
   - Modify makefiles to output binaries to the new directory structure
   - Organize makefiles in the new `/build/makefiles/` directory

2. **Update binary paths**
   - Ensure all scripts and configurations reference the new binary locations

3. **Test build process**
   - Verify that builds successfully create binaries in the correct locations
   - Test both production and debug builds

## Phase 5: Validation and Cleanup

1. **Full system test**
   - Run a comprehensive test of the entire system
   - Verify all components work correctly with the new structure

2. **Documentation update**
   - Update any documentation that references file paths
   - Create a migration summary document

3. **Clean up remnants**
   - Remove any backup files or temporary files created during migration
   - Delete empty directories from the old structure

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 1 day | None |
| Phase 2 | 3 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 2 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 4 | 2 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 5 | 2 days | Phases 2-4 |

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Version Control**
   - Commit all changes to a separate branch
   - Create checkpoints after each major step
   - Only merge to main after thorough testing

2. **Backups**
   - Create a full backup of the project before starting
   - Don't delete original files until new structure is verified

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Maintain ability to revert to original structure if serious issues arise
   - Document any manual changes that cannot be automated

## Success Criteria

The reorganization will be considered successful when:
1. All files are in their appropriate directories
2. The system builds successfully with the new structure
3. All tests pass
4. Logs are properly categorized in the new directory structure
5. Binary output goes to the correct directories
6. No regression in functionality
